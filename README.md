## My process

I like to work section by section in a linear fashion. Starting with the biggest pieces. Once I have them where I want I try and style them as I go. Once I have the page looking like I want I go back and try to seperate and optimize styles and structures for the sake of readability.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have known HTML and CSS for a long time but really haven't worked in either of them in quite a while. This project was an excellent refresher and great opportunity to knock of the rust!

I really tried to organize the HTML in an efficeint way so styling became much easier. 

I was really pleased with the end result and as I worked my way through the project I began to pickup momentum and really flew through it near the end.


### Continued development

In future projects I want to start using some css libraries/architectures such as flexbox, grid, or even some JS libraries to help make the pages more modular and easier to structure and style.
